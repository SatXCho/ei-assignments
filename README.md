## Exercise-2
---
1. **Grid Initialization**: The simulation initializes a grid of specified size (e.g., `10x10`), sets the Roverâ€™s starting position, direction (N, E, S, W), and places obstacles at given coordinates.
2. **Commands**: The Rover follows commands (`M`, `L`, `R`) to move forward, turn left, and turn right respectively.
3. **Obstacle Detection**: The Rover avoids obstacles and halts its movement if one is detected in its path.
4. **Rover Status**: The current position and direction of the Rover can be displayed anytime using the `status` command.

## Input/Output

### Initialization Command
Initializes the grid, the rover's position, direction, and obstacles:
```
init <grid-size> <start-position> <start-direction> <obstacles>
```
- **grid-size**: Format `WxH` (e.g., `10x10`)
- **start-position**: Rover's initial coordinates `(x, y)` (e.g., `0,0`)
- **start-direction**: Rover's initial direction `N`, `E`, `S`, or `W`
- **obstacles**: Comma-separated list of obstacle coordinates in the format `(x1,y1),(x2,y2)` (e.g., `(2,2),(3,5)`)

**Example**:
```
init 10x10 0,0 N (2,2),(3,5)
```
- Initializes a 10x10 grid, sets the Rover at position (0,0), facing North, with obstacles at (2,2) and (3,5).

### Command Execution
Processes a sequence of commands to move and rotate the Rover:
```
command <command-sequence>
```
- **M**: Move forward in the current direction.
- **L**: Turn left.
- **R**: Turn right.

**Example**:
```
command m m r m l m
```
- Moves forward twice, turns right, moves forward once, turns left, and moves forward.

### Status Command
Displays the current status of the Rover, including its position, direction, and obstacle detection.
```
status
```


## Obstacle Detection
Before moving, the Rover checks if the next position contains an obstacle or is out of bounds. If an obstacle is detected, the Rover halts its movement and logs a message:
```csharp
 public bool IsPositionValid(int x, int y)
    {
        if (x < 0 || x >= width || y < 0 || y >= height)
            return false;

        return !obstacles.Contains((x, y));
    }
```
```csharp
 if (grid.IsPositionValid(newX, newY))
        {
            x = newX;
            y = newY;
            _logger.LogInformation($"Rover moved to ({x}, {y}).");
        }
```
